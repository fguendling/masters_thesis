Class scrbook Info: You've used standard option `oneside'.
(scrbook)           This is correct!
(scrbook)           Internally I'm using `twoside=false'.
(scrbook)           If you'd like to set the option with \KOMAoptions,
(scrbook)           you'd have to use `twoside=false' there
(scrbook)           instead of `oneside', too.


Class scrbook Warning: You've used obsolete option `pointlessnumbers'.
(scrbook)              Usage of this option indicates an old document
(scrbook)              and changes compatibility level using
(scrbook)              `numbers=noenddot,version=first,
(scrbook)              enabledeprecatedfontcommands' that may result
(scrbook)              in further warnings.
(scrbook)              If you don't want this, you should simply
(scrbook)              replace option `pointlessnumbers' by `numbers=noenddot'.


Class scrbook Info: Switching compatibility level to `first'.

Class scrbook Warning: deprecated option `enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.
(scrbook)              Note, that this option was already depreacted when
(scrbook)              it has been defined. Support for old font commands
(scrbook)              has been removed from KOMA-Script more than one
(scrbook)              decade ago. It is not recommended to use them any
(scrbook)              longer. Therefore usage of this class option also
(scrbook)              is not recommended.
